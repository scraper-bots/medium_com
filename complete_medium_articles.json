Is it 95% sure?\n\nAnd does that mean the truth is inside the interval 95% of the time, or… something else?\n\nThe more I read, the more I realized confidence intervals are all about estimating an unknown number — say, the average height of a population, or the true effect of a new medication — based on a sample of data.\n\nAnd instead of giving you just one best guess, it gives you a range of values where the true answer is likely to be.\n\nIt’s like saying, “We’re not certain, but here’s the zone we’d bet on, based on the evidence we have.”\n\nBut it turns out, that comforting “95% confidence” has a very specific meaning — and it’s not quite what I originally thought.\n\nIt doesn’t mean there’s a 95% chance the true number is in your interval.\n\nIt means that if you repeated the study over and over, 95% of those intervals would contain the true value.\n\nIt’s subtle — but kind of mind-blowing.",

From code-generating tools to smart chatbots, it sometimes feels like the machines are coming for every job — especially jobs in tech.\n\nIt’s no wonder many aspiring programmers and computer science students worry: “Will AI make my developer skills obsolete?”\n\nThis fear of being replaced by AI is real (around a fifth of U.S. workers share it​), but it’s also largely overblown.\n\nIn reality, becoming a software developer (or pursuing that CS degree) is still one of the smartest moves you can make.\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore why human developers are here to stay, how a CS education gives you supercharged problem-solving abilities, and why being tech-savvy remains a long-term asset — even as AI becomes a bigger part of the picture.\n\nAlong the way, we’ll talk about adapting to change, embracing AI rather than fearing it, and how to future-proof your tech career.\n\nBy the end, you should feel confident (and excited) about pursuing a path in software development in the age of AI.\n\nLet’s dive in!\n\n## The Overblown Fear of “AI Replacing…",

This article presents a comprehensive forensic analysis of the registered users table in a banking app, focusing on how device identifiers are assigned and used, patterns in user behavior, and methodologies to detect fraud.\n\nWe diving into how device IDs are generated and maintained, ways attackers might spoof or manipulate these identifiers, and how to trace users even when thousands of accounts share the same device ID. We also analyze user behavior — from transaction activity and account balances to IP address clustering and multi-device usage — to uncover suspicious patterns. Finally, we outline fraud detection techniques (including anomaly indicators and collusion detection) and discuss industry best practices and regulatory considerations surrounding user tracking, fraud prevention, and privacy.\n\n## Device ID Assignment and Integrity\n\nMechanism of Device ID Generation: Banking apps typically generate a unique Device ID for each installation or device.

But why do these models work so well in the context of fraud detection?\n\nIn this article, we’ll explore the strengths of tree-based and graph-based machine learning models and explain why they are particularly well-suited for identifying fraudulent activities.\n\n## Tree-Based Models and Fraud Detection\n\nTree-based models, such as decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines (GBMs), are widely used in fraud detection for several reasons:\n\n### 1. Handling Non-Linear and Complex Relationships\n\nFraudulent patterns often do not follow simple linear relationships. Fraudsters may behave differently depending on various factors, and these behaviors can vary across different contexts. Tree-based…",

In this article, we’ll break down four categories of time series forecasting methods — classical statistical models, machine learning models (ML), deep learning models (DL), and hybrid models — with clear examples for each one.\n\n### 1. Classical Statistical Models\n\nClassical statistical models focus on identifying patterns like trends and seasonality in historical data and leveraging those to predict future values.\n\na) ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)\n\nARIMA is one of the most popular classical models for time series forecasting. It captures both the linear relationships in data and any potential trend (via “differencing”).\nHow it works: ARIMA uses past values (autoregressive part, AR) and past errors (moving average, MA) to make predictions. The “Integrated” part (I) involves differencing to stabilize a trend over time.Example: Let’s say you’re…",

It divides features into five categories:\nBasic Needs (Must-Haves): These are essential features. If missing, they result in dissatisfaction, but having them doesn’t necessarily increase satisfaction.Performance Needs: The more these features are present, the more satisfied customers will be.

User Stories: The Heart of Agile Requirements\n\n## Overview\n\nUser Stories are the cornerstone of Agile requirements gathering. A User Story is a brief, simple description of a feature from the perspective of an end-user. Written in non-technical language, user stories capture what the user needs and why they need it. The typical format is:\n\nAs a [type of user], I want [a goal] so that [a reason].",

Explained with Examples\n\nIsmat Samadov\n\n5 min read\n·Oct 23, 2024\n\n--\n\nShare\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nPhoto by Annie Spratt on Unsplash\nIn Agile project management, a User Story is a simple, concise description of a feature or functionality written from the perspective of the end user. It focuses on the value that the feature brings to the user rather than on the technical details. User stories are designed to capture a small unit of work that delivers meaningful value to the user and are a key component of the Agile framework.\n\nUser stories help the development team understand who the user is, what they need, and why they need it. This approach keeps the focus on delivering value and ensures that the team works on tasks that directly contribute to the overall goals of the project.\n\n## 1. Definition of a User Story\n\nA User Story typically follows a simple structure:\n\nAs a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].\n\nThis format ensures that the story is user-focused and explains the functionality from the user’s point of view. By centering on the user’s needs, the development team can better prioritize work that delivers real value.\n\n## Key Components of a User Story:\nRole: Who is the end user (e.g., customer, admin, user)?Goal: What does the user want to achieve?",
